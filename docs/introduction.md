# Introduction

## John Åhl
I'm an advanced game programmer and gameplay programmer with over 20 years of experience in programming and deep expertise in Unreal Engine. With a strong foundation in C++ and Unreal Engine Blueprints, I specialize in developing high-performance gameplay systems and multiplayer experiences.

I have extensive experience working on multiplayer games, mastering networking, replication, and online infrastructure. Beyond game development, I run my own game development company, offering over 25 products, including Blueprint systems and integrations for Steam, Epic Online Services, Amazon GameLift, and other essential tools for developers.

In addition to game programming, I have experience working with Linux and Unix servers, ensuring robust backend solutions for hosting, dedicated servers, and cloud-based multiplayer services.

From crafting immersive gameplay mechanics to optimizing performance and leading programming teams, I thrive on solving complex technical challenges and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in game development.
