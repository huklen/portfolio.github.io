# ABOUT ME

### John Ahl
I'm an advanced game programmer and gameplay programmer with over 20 years of experience in programming and deep expertise in Unreal Engine. With a strong foundation in C++ and Unreal Engine Blueprints, I specialize in developing high-performance gameplay systems and multiplayer experiences.

I have extensive experience working on multiplayer games, mastering networking, replication, and online infrastructure. Beyond game development, I run my own game [development company](https://eeldev.com), offering over [25 products](https://www.fab.com/sellers/eelDev), including Blueprint systems and integrations for Steam, Epic Online Services, Amazon GameLift, and other essential tools for developers.

In addition to game programming, I have experience working with Linux and Unix servers, ensuring robust backend solutions for hosting, dedicated servers, and cloud-based multiplayer services.

When I'm not deep in code, I enjoy life in the northern forests of **Sweden**, where I live with my partner and daughter. The quiet wilderness gives me the perfect balance between high-intensity development and peaceful moments in natureâ€”though Iâ€™d be lying if I said I donâ€™t bring game ideas with me on every walk.

From crafting immersive gameplay mechanics to optimizing performance and leading programming teams, I thrive on solving complex technical challenges and pushing the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible in game development.
