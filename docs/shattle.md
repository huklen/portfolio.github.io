## Information
A third-person multiplayer shooter where I was recruited to overhaul the networking infrastructure. The game initially lacked dedicated servers and matchmaking, so I was brought in to:

## Tasks
* Convert the game to a dedicated server model
* Implement a matchmaking system
* Ensure a scalable and stable multiplayer experience

## Links
- [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1730580/Shattle/)

#### Additional Notes:
- This was an exciting technical challenge that I handled independently.
