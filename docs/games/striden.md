# STRIDEN (PvP)
**Role**: Lead Programmer 

I started as the **sole programmer** on **STRIDEN**, building its entire foundation in **C++ for Unreal Engine**, utilizing **Epic's Gameplay Ability System (GAS)** for a scalable and modular architecture. As the team expanded, I transitioned into a **Lead Programmer role**, mentoring new developers and guiding them through the projectâ€™s systems.

 ## Key Contributions
- **Core Systems Development**: Implemented character movement, shooting mechanics, animation systems, and game mode logic.  
- **Multiplayer & Networking**: Designed matchmaking, replication, and networking features.  
- **Gameplay Mechanics**: Developed damage, health, and stamina systems.  
- **Backend & Server Integration**: Set up **Steam integration** and **Amazon GameLift dedicated servers**.  
- **Leadership & Mentorship**: Onboarded and mentored new programmers, ensuring smooth integration into the development pipeline.  

Taking **STRIDEN** from the ground up and later leading the programming team was both a challenge and a rewarding experience, solidifying my skills in **game architecture, multiplayer development, and leadership**.
