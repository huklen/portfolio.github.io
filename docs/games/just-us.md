# Just Us – *Co-op Multiplayer Survival Game*  
**Role:** Solo Developer  

I single-handedly built *Just Us* from the ground up using **C++ in Unreal Engine**, leveraging **Epic’s Gameplay Ability System** to create a modular and scalable foundation. My work covered:  

- **Core Gameplay Systems:** Character movement, shooting mechanics, and animation systems.  
- **Multiplayer & Networking:** Dedicated server setup, matchmaking, Steam integration, and multiplayer mechanics.  
- **Game Logic & Systems:** Game mode mechanics, damage system, health and stamina management.  
- **AI & NPC Behavior:** Pathfinding, decision-making, and survival mechanics for NPCs.  
- **Survival Mechanics:** Hunger, thirst, temperature, and environmental hazards.  
- **Dynamic Weather System:** Real-time weather affecting gameplay and survival conditions.  
- **Project Management:** Designed, developed, and managed the entire project independently.  

The project is currently **paused** as I transitioned to working on *STRIDEN*, where I took on a key role as the game's **Lead Programmer**.
