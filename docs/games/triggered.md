# TRIGGERED - Co-op Multiplayer Speed Runner Game
**Role:** Solo Developer

*TRIGGERED* is a fast-paced co-op multiplayer speed runner game where players work together to complete challenging levels under intense time pressure. As the sole programmer on the project, I was responsible for designing and implementing the entire technical foundation of the game. Using Unreal Engine and C++, I built a robust and scalable system that supported core gameplay mechanics, multiplayer functionality, and Steam integration. Despite being my first commercial release on Steam, I successfully delivered a polished and functional game, showcasing my ability to tackle complex challenges independently.  

- **Core Systems Development**: Designed and implemented foundational systems including character movement, shooting mechanics, animation systems, game mode logic, damage and health systems, and multiplayer networking.  
- **Multiplayer Integration**: Built matchmaking and multiplayer mechanics, ensuring smooth and responsive online gameplay experiences.  
- **Steam Integration**: Successfully integrated Steamworks SDK for achievements, matchmaking, and storefront functionality.  
- **Solo Development**: Managed the entire project independently, from initial concept to release, demonstrating strong project management and problem-solving skills.  
- **Technical Challenges**: Overcame significant hurdles as a solo developer, delivering a scalable and modular codebase using Epic’s Gameplay Abilities System.  
- **Commercial Release**: Published *TRIGGERED* on Steam, marking my first commercially available game.  
- **Project Status**: The project was paused due to limited market traction, but the foundation remains solid for future development or iteration.
